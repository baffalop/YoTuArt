# YoTuArt: @youtubeartifact downloader

This is a script to be run as a cron job, to download images from the Twitter account [@youtubeartifact](https://twitter.com/youtubeartifact).

My macOS is set to use the images as wallpapers. Eventually, I'd like to be able to manage the wallpapers (print which are currently displaying, pin favourites, delete disliked ones).
